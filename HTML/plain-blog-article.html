    </p>
    <h2>1954 The strat was born</h2>
    <p>The strat was originally designed by <em>Leo Fender</em>, <em>Bill Carson</em>, <em>George Fullerton</em> and <em>Freddie Tavares</em>. The strat had a revolutionary design for the time it was designed, it had a slim body, 3 pickups, contoured body (so it was really comfortable to use) 
        and the best of all, it had a modular design, Leo designed the strat to make it easy to repair, you can change everything in a strat, from tuners to electronics, to pickups going as far as neck and body.</p>
    <h2>Famous strat players</h2>
    <p>Basically every guitar player on earth has played a strat or a strat clone, and it's used by musicians of every genre of music</p>
